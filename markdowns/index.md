### Hi there! I'm Conor. Welcome to my personal blog!

#### Let me introduce myself:

I'm a college student, while my university isn't in Shanghai, but I've visited this city many times before. This summer vacation, I've decided to come back to challenge myself. Since I can communicate in basic English, I thought it'd be great to help foreign friends in Shanghai with everyday tasks, not only to assist others, but also to improve my English and make new friends along the way! (So that's why I made that Reddit post)

#### About fees:
Honestly, I don't want to mislead anyone. I'm still unsure how to price my services because I'm not entirely sure what my skills are worth or how much I can actually help. So, I won't set a fixed rate.
#### But I can promise this: I'll give my absolute best when assisting you!

Just the opportunity to practice English and help someone is already rewarding for me (after all, I'm just a student trying to grow during my break).

So don't worry about payment upfront. After we've finished, you can decide what (if anything) to pay based on how satisfied you are. If you're not satisfied, it's completely free!

#### Think of us less as a transaction and more like making a friend in China. I'd genuinely love to help out or just hang out with you!

<br /><br />
#### Here's my timetable
- it may not be 100% precise because I occasionally forget to set it. XD
